# Explain why it is or why it is not a big data problem.

# Why is it an analytics problem?

# How many data attributes are there?

As can be seen from the result of `colnames(dat)`, we know that the data set contains 58 attributes.

```{r}
colnames(dat)
```
# Identify the type of the 15 attributes you find most relevant in this context.


# Determine whether the task refers to a supervised or unsupervised learning problem

# Find out what the standard analysis algorithms are for this analytics problem.

# Provide descriptive summaries of the sample data

```{r}
summary(dat)
```

# How are the missings distributed?
